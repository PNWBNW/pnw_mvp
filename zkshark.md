# ZKSHARK: Modular zkStack for Ghostnet-Aggregated Zero-Knowledge Systems

**ZKSHARK** (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Hybrid Argument of Recursive Knowledge) is a next-gen zk system built for decentralized and auditable applications with high throughput, low proof cost, and long-term modular verifiability.

---

## Architectural Overview

ZKSHARK is divided into **four layers**—each optimized using a best-in-class zk-proof system:

### 1. **Worker Data Commitments → Poseidon / Rescue Prime**
- Hash-based commitment of raw input data (ZPass ID, ANS address, payroll record, etc.).
- Provides ZK-friendly encoding with low gas costs.
- Uses either:
  - **Poseidon** (default Aleo-native ZK hash)
  - **Rescue Prime** (higher security margin, ZKSHARK preferred)
- Embedded directly into record creation (e.g. `BHP256::commit_to_field(...)` style).

---

### 2. **Snail Circuit Proofs → Virgo**
- Each *snail* handles an isolated function: payroll, taxes, employer onboarding, etc.
- **Virgo** provides ultra-fast proving for each snail via FFT-free polynomial commitment and streaming GKR logic.
- Enables real-time circuit verification with polylogarithmic verifier time.

---

### 3. **Ghostnet Aggregation Layer → Scarab GKR**
- Scarab powers a "Ghostnet" of zk aggregation daemons.
- Each snail circuit submits its Virgo-proofed result upward.
- Scarab then recursively combines proof outputs using **Goldreich-Kahan-Rothblum (GKR)**–style reduction.
- Great for scaling to millions of records with sublinear proof size.

---

### 4. **Final State Root → Recursive Spartan Fold**
- Final zkLedger state is compressed using Spartan-style folding.
- Transparent (no trusted setup) and recursively composable.
- Ideal for proof-carrying data, off-chain light clients, and long-term audit trails.

## zkStack Summary

| Layer                    | ZK System Used     | Purpose                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Worker Commitments       | Poseidon / Rescue  | Efficient, secure field commitments         |
| Snail Circuit Execution  | Virgo              | Fast, streaming ZK verification             |
| Ghostnet Aggregation     | Scarab GKR         | Recursive zk-middleware for coordination    |
| Final State Compression  | Spartan            | Folding all outputs into one zkProof        |

## Benefits

- **Modular ZK**: Each zk-snail is independently upgradable.
- **Quantum-Resilient (512-bit hash roots)**: Resistant to Grover’s algorithm via Rescue.
- **Recursive + Transparent**: No trusted setup, fully on-chain verifiable.
- **Optimized for Aleo**: Compatible with Leo 2.5+ programs and composable smart contract outputs.

Snail Layer: Modular Integrity in ZKShark

In the ZKShark architecture, the Snail Layer forms the foundation of secure, auditable computation. Each Snail is a lightweight, function-specific prover that continuously verifies a focused category of logic (e.g., payroll hash validation, worker credential compliance, employer registration timestamps).


---

Core Benefits

1. Isolated Error Detection
Each snail executes a narrow verification logic across relevant blockheight ranges.
This modularity enables:

Easier bug tracking

Lower error propagation risk

Easier validation of logic rollback or replay


2. Anti-Spoofing Defense
Because each snail computes proofs independently, attempts to spoof or inject tampered data (e.g. fake worker hashes or retroactive tax edits) can be caught by mismatches between Snail proofs and state expectations.

3. ZK Efficiency Through Specialization
Each Snail is compiled to prove just one thing well. This allows circuits to be compiled smaller and faster than generalized ZK-SNARKs, optimizing for gas and proving time.

How Snails Interact with Ghostnet

Snail microproofs are committed into the Ghostnet, a GKR-based aggregation layer that:

Verifies consistency across Snails

Merkle-compresses state updates

Escalates errors or mismatches back to governance or trusted agents



---

Analogy

Think of Snails as independent auditors, each assigned to a department.
Ghostnet acts like the auditor general, combining all results into a verified, immutable checkpoint.


---

This structure dramatically improves trust and traceability in zero-knowledge systems, especially across decentralized or compliance-sensitive applications like payroll, public registries, or DAOs.
