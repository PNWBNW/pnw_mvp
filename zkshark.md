# ZKSHARK: Modular zkStack for Ghostnet-Aggregated Zero-Knowledge Systems

**ZKSHARK** (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Hybrid Argument of Recursive Knowledge) is a next-gen zk system built for decentralized and auditable applications with high throughput, low proof cost, and long-term modular verifiability.

---

## Architectural Overview

ZKSHARK is divided into **four layers**—each optimized using a best-in-class zk-proof system:

### 1. **Worker Data Commitments → Poseidon / Rescue Prime**
- Hash-based commitment of raw input data (ZPass ID, ANS address, payroll record, etc.).
- Provides ZK-friendly encoding with low gas costs.
- Uses either:
  - **Poseidon** (default Aleo-native ZK hash)
  - **Rescue Prime** (higher security margin, ZKSHARK preferred)
- Embedded directly into record creation (e.g. `BHP256::commit_to_field(...)` style).

---

### 2. **Snail Circuit Proofs → Virgo**
- Each *snail* handles an isolated function: payroll, taxes, employer onboarding, etc.
- **Virgo** provides ultra-fast proving for each snail via FFT-free polynomial commitment and streaming GKR logic.
- Enables real-time circuit verification with polylogarithmic verifier time.

---

### 3. **Ghostnet Aggregation Layer → Scarab GKR**
- Scarab powers a "Ghostnet" of zk aggregation daemons.
- Each snail circuit submits its Virgo-proofed result upward.
- Scarab then recursively combines proof outputs using **Goldreich-Kahan-Rothblum (GKR)**–style reduction.
- Great for scaling to millions of records with sublinear proof size.

---

### 4. **Final State Root → Recursive Spartan Fold**
- Final zkLedger state is compressed using Spartan-style folding.
- Transparent (no trusted setup) and recursively composable.
- Ideal for proof-carrying data, off-chain light clients, and long-term audit trails.

## zkStack Summary

| Layer                    | ZK System Used     | Purpose                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Worker Commitments       | Poseidon / Rescue  | Efficient, secure field commitments         |
| Snail Circuit Execution  | Virgo              | Fast, streaming ZK verification             |
| Ghostnet Aggregation     | Scarab GKR         | Recursive zk-middleware for coordination    |
| Final State Compression  | Spartan            | Folding all outputs into one zkProof        |

## Benefits

- **Modular ZK**: Each zk-snail is independently upgradable.
- **Quantum-Resilient (512-bit hash roots)**: Resistant to Grover’s algorithm via Rescue.
- **Recursive + Transparent**: No trusted setup, fully on-chain verifiable.
- **Optimized for Aleo**: Compatible with Leo 2.5+ programs and composable smart contract outputs.

## Usage Example

- **Payroll Snail** → Validates payment with Virgo
- **Ghostnet** → Compresses proof using Scarab
- **Final Layer** → Spartan folds proof into ZKSHARK ledger state
