zkSHARK: Phantom-Proof Layer for Sovereign Agricultural Data

Overview

zkSHARK (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Hybrid Argument of Recursive Knowledge) is a modular, quantum-resilient, Merkle-driven proof system. It enables farm-operated data to be compiled off-chain and published as zk-proven commitments via a phantom audit trail called the GhostNet.

GhostNet is zkSHARK. It’s not a separate chain—it’s the zk-layer embedded in zkSHARK that logs proof-of-activity at each block height, without exposing raw data.

Core Design

1. Sovereign Snail Nodes

Each farm runs a snail: a background agent collecting and organizing:

Payroll logs

Crop cycles

Compliance records


Snails produce Merkle roots of their data without broadcasting content.

2. zkSHARK Aggregators

A zkSHARK instance consumes Merkle roots from one or more snails and produces:

A compressed zk commitment

Anchored to the current block height


Example Leo logic:

let root: field = Merkle::commit(data_array);
let proof: field = BHP256::commit_to_field(root, salt);
ghost_commits.set(block.height, proof);

3. Embedded GhostNet Layer

GhostNet is the invisible zk layer:

Exists entirely within zkSHARK mappings

Stores compressed zk records (ghost_commits) per block height

Cannot be reversed into data, only zk-verified


GhostNet is not an L2—it is a phantom zk scaffold inside the Aleo chain.

4. Modular Snail Model

Each snail handles a single function:

Snail A: weekly_payroll

Snail B: crop_rotation

Snail C: fertilizer_tracking


Snails produce localized Merkle roots. zkSHARK compresses and commits.

5. zkSHARK vs SNARK/STARK

Feature	zkSHARK	SNARK/STARK

Aggregation Model	Phantom block height commit	Transaction-based proofs
Proof Origin	Merkle from individual functions	Monolithic circuits
Quantum Security	512-bit + lattice support ready	Limited (SNARKs especially)
Data Sovereignty	Farm/local node controlled	Usually prover-controlled
Auditability	zk-openable via root + witness	Often opaque unless designed



---

Future Extensions

Lattice-based extension for quantum resilience

Toggleable snail modules (e.g. RETIREMENT_FUNDS=true) via .env

Optional zk-opening for local councils, certifiers, exporters

Why zkSHARK Is Unique

GhostNet isn't a chain—it's the invisible heartbeat of zkSHARK.

Every proof is modular, aggregated, and time-stamped.

No raw data lives on-chain—only provable commitment anchors.
