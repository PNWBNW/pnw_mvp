This script is part of the **Proven National Workers (PNW) MVP** deployment architecture. It provides modular, toggle-based deployment logic for Aleo smart contracts using `.env` files for dynamic control.

## Purpose

The `deploy_pnw_mvp.sh` script was built to:
- Automate controlled deployment of multiple Aleo programs
- Respect project-specific `.env` flags per module
- Minimize manual errors, especially in modular zero-knowledge systems
- Support secure build flows with Leo CLI and GitHub Actions

## Intellectual Property

This script, and its surrounding deployment design, are the **sole property** of the Founder of the PNW project. It was developed through a proprietary iterative process involving:

- Smart contract logic developed for the Proven National Workers project
- Custom deployment toggles using `.env` orchestration
- Project-specific tooling decisions

**It is NOT open-source** and **may not be reused, forked, redistributed, or adapted** without **explicit written permission**.
