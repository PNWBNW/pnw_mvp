# PNW-MVP Deployment Script (`deploy_pnw_mvp.sh`)

This script is part of the **Proven National Workers (PNW) MVP** deployment architecture. It implements modular, toggle-based deployment logic using `.env` files for dynamic control of smart contract lifecycles.

## Purpose

The `deploy_pnw_mvp.sh` and "deploy_crosschain.sh" scripts were created to:
- Automate controlled deployments of Aleo and potentially other ZK-compatible smart contracts
- Respect per-project `.env` toggles to prevent accidental builds
- Support reproducible, modular zero-knowledge flows within GitHub Actions or CI pipelines
- Offer a secure plug-and-play deployment baseline across multiple chains

## Intellectual Property

This script and its architecture are the **exclusive intellectual property** of the PNW project founder. It was built through a proprietary, iterative development process including:

- Contract-specific orchestration logic
- Dynamic toggling across modules via `.env`
- Custom deployment sequencing for Leo and beyond

## Enforcement

## Final Notes

This tooling is designed for compliant, modular smart contract deployment.  
Its protection ensures integrity for real-world zero-knowledge and identity-linked contract ecosystems.
