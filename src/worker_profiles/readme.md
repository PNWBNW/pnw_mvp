# worker_profiles.aleo

The `worker_profiles` program is part of the PNW MVP system and provides a self-sovereign, private, and decentralized registry for worker metadata on-chain.

## Purpose

- Allow workers to register their identity and employment metadata in a secure, auditable, yet fully private manner.
- Allow affiliated subDAOs to manage and verify worker registration in compliance with internal governance standards.
- Eliminate reliance on external global name registries.

## Data Model

### Worker Struct

```leo
struct Worker {
    is_pniw: bool,                      // true = PNiW, false = PNCW
    country_of_origin: [u8; 3],         // ISO country code (if PNiW only)
    industry_code: u8,                  // Industry code (1â€“15)
    has_dependents: bool,               // Tax filing flag
    state_of_residency: [u8; 2],        // US state abbreviation (e.g., "CA")
    subdao_affiliation: address,        // Address of subDAO the worker is affiliated with
    _nonce: group                       // Randomized salt for privacy
}

Registration Workflow

A worker calls register_worker() with their data payload.

If is_pniw == false (PNCW), the country_of_origin must be zeroed ([0u8, 0u8, 0u8]).

Industry code must be within range 1..=15.

Design Principles

Self-sovereign: Worker identity data is controlled and updated solely by the worker.

Privacy-preserving: No human-readable names are stored on-chain. All data is internal to PNW contracts.

Extensible: Future fields such as certifications, worker hashes, or employment status can be added as needed.

SubDAO compatible: Each worker is linked to a subDAO for auditability and governance.
