This directory contains **custom employer-configured worker profiles**, using:
‚úî **Aleo Name Service (ANS) for workers & SubDAOs**

2Ô∏è‚É£ Running the CLI Script

Aleo employers should use register_workers.sh to batch register workers.

üìå Steps to Execute

1. Ensure employer_worker_config.json is correctly formatted.


2. Make the script executable:

chmod +x register_workers.sh


3. Run the script:

./worker_profiles/register_workers.sh



üí° How It Works

Reads employer_worker_config.json

Extracts each worker‚Äôs ANS name, ZPass ID, and wallet address

Calls the Aleo contract register_worker transition:

leo run register_worker <worker_address> <category> <subdao_ans> <zpass_id>
