# Proven Noncitizen Workers (PNW-MVP)

**A privacy-focused digital payroll and compliance system built for agricultural workers and small employers.**

---

## What Is PNW-MVP?

The **PNW-MVP** project is a digital system built to help **farmers, small businesses, and noncitizen workers** manage payroll and taxes securely — without paperwork, middlemen, or exposure of private data.

This system runs on a **new type of internet called Aleo**, where information is **private by default** but **verifiable by regulators**.

---

## Why It Matters

In many industries — especially farming — it's hard for employers to:

- Stay tax compliant
- Protect worker privacy
- Keep track of payroll
- Avoid red tape and fees

**PNW-MVP fixes that.** It provides a **fair, private, and secure way** to pay workers and send taxes — automatically — using digital tools.

---

## Who It's For

- **Workers**: You get paid weekly without exposing personal info.
- **Employers**: You stay compliant and protect your workers' privacy.
- **DAOs / Co-ops**: You manage shared reserves and payroll across teams.
- **Governments**: You get transparent, auditable tax flows — without revealing sensitive identities.

---

## How It Works (Simple Terms)

- Employers sign up in the system.
- Workers are registered without names — only safe digital IDs.
- A digital payroll pool pays workers every week.
- Taxes are calculated and reserved **automatically**.
- SubDAOs (small teams or co-ops) manage their own reserves.

Everything happens **on-chain** — meaning no paperwork, no banks, no middlemen — just math.

## Privacy & Security

PNW-MVP uses **zero-knowledge cryptography**, which lets the system:

- Prove someone is paid **without revealing their identity**
- Prove taxes are paid **without showing the amount**
- Keep records secure — even from the platform itself
